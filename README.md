# Classification-Using-Vision-RAG
This repository implements an image classification pipeline using Vision RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). It leverages a pre-trained vision model for feature extraction and retrieves relevant external knowledge to enhance classification accuracy.

Traing dataset has been taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset?resource=download
